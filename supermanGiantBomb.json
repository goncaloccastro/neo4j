The game loosely follows the plot of the first two films in the Superman series starring Christopher Reeve. The enemies in the game are Lex Luthor and General Zod. The player is given a map of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-114\" href=\"/metropolis/3035-114/\">Metropolis</a> and is told where to go in the game. Oddly though, Superman is not able to fly anywhere unless he gets a special powerup. Most of the time he has to walk, battling enemies on the way. The player starts out in the game as Clark Kent, but is able to change into Superman in a telephone booth if they have enough super powers built up. The game is played in a sidescrolling view and, like most Superman games, is of a generally poor quality.</p><h3>Super Powers</h3><ul><li>X-Ray vision</li><li>Super Flight</li><li>Super Spin</li><li>Heat Vision</li><li>Super Hearing</li><li>Super Breath I</li><li>Super Breath II</li></ul>","resource_type":"game","expected_release_month":null,"deck":"A sidescrolling action game based on the Superman franchise, created for the NES by Seika and Kemco.","date_last_updated":"2013-06-13 00:38:25","original_release_date":"1988-12-12 00:00:00","platforms":[{"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System","api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/","id":21,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/","abbreviation":"NES"}],"id":22981,"expected_release_year":null,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/superman/3030-22981/","expected_release_day":null,"date_added":"2008-08-05 07:27:19","original_game_rating":null},{"aliases":"Super-Man","number_of_user_reviews":0,"name":"Superman","expected_release_quarter":null,"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-769/","image":{"super_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2367838-a2600_superman.jpg","thumb_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2367838-a2600_superman.jpg","tiny_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2367838-a2600_superman.jpg","medium_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2367838-a2600_superman.jpg","small_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2367838-a2600_superman.jpg","screen_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2367838-a2600_superman.jpg","icon_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2367838-a2600_superman.jpg"},"description":"<p>Superman opens with a bridge being blown apart by a helicopter-pack-wearing <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6225\" href=\"/lex-luthor/3005-6225/\" slug=\"lex-luthor\">Lex Luthor</a> and his gang of thugs. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-47\" href=\"/superman/3005-47/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a>--who begins the game as Clark Kent--must head into a phone booth, change clothes, and head out to capture the criminals and find the scattered bridge pieces.

The only danger comes in the form of blinking kryptonite satellites, which float around the world and emit beeping noises. Should Superman run into one of these easily avoided dangers, he loses the ability to fly, forcing players to walk around on-foot in search of Lois Lane. Touching Lois recharges Superman, allowing him to fly again. There is also a helicopter in the city that can pick up bridge pieces, criminals, kryptonite, and Lois, making them harder to catch.

It was released on May 31, 1999 for the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a> and was developed and published by <a href=\"/titus-interactive-sa/3010-165/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-165\">Titus Interactive</a>. The game is notorious for its overwhelmingly negative reception from critics.</p><h2>Story</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game opens with <a href=\"/lex-luthor/3005-6225/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6225\">Lex Luthor</a> kidnapping <a href=\"/lois-lane/3005-6228/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6228\">Lois Lane</a>, <a href=\"/jimmy-olsen/3005-10216/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10216\">Jimmy Olsen</a>, and Dr. Emil Hamilton. They're placed into a virtual recreation of <a href=\"/metropolis/3035-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-114\">Metropolis</a>, so <a href=\"/superman/3005-47/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-47\">Superman</a> must enter this world to rescue them. At the beginning of the game Luthor states, \"If you want to save your friends, solve my <a href=\"/maze/3015-528/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-528\">maze</a>!\" The \"maze\", however, consists of hoops scattered about the virtual world that Superman must fly through before time runs out. If the player strays too far from the hoops, time will be deducted and the player will fail the level.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Superman's powers and speed have been greatly diminished from the canon of the show, which the developers explain as <a href=\"/kryptonite/3055-1216/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1216\">\"kryptonite</a> fog\" (actually the fog hiding the draw distance colored green) limiting his powers. The player must fly through several sets of the aforementioned rings to reach an objective such as defeating a set number of thugs or picking up cars. Failure to complete the ring courses under the time limit will force the player to start over. If successful, the player can enter the action segments consisting of one-button combat. Superman's powers such as ice breath or heat vision can be used, but they must be acquired as pick-ups and can only be used for a few seconds.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2218/250660-superman64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-250660\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.54147465437788\" data-width=\"434\" style=\"width: 434px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2218/250660-superman64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-250660\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2218/250660-superman64.jpg\" alt=\"Rings are a common obstacle.\"></a><figcaption>Rings are a common obstacle.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game also contains multiplayer; a deathmatch mode and a race mode. In deathmatch, the players play as various Superman characters as they pilot ships such as the ship that delivered Superman to <a href=\"/earth/3035-65/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-65\">Earth</a>. Players fly around in an attempt to shoot each other down in a mode similar to <a href=\"/star-fox-64/3030-19203/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19203\">Star Fox 64's</a> multiplayer. Various power-ups are scattered around the map that players can use to take down other players such as lock on missiles, as well as shields that offer invincibility.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As for the race mode, one player places rings around a track and the other players must go through them to be victorious. This mode however can also be won by shooting down every other player, turning it into a deathmatch, and rendering it pointless. The multiplayer can be played with up to four players.</p><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Superman was universally panned by critics. Common complaints included the overly sensitive flying controls, the poor graphics and animations, the poor use of superpowers, and the repetitive nature of the game. One common complaint was the thick kryptonite fog. The prevalence of thick fog is not uncommon in Nintendo 64 titles due to the hardware's draw distance limitations, but on top of all of the game's other technical and design issues, it seemed absurd for Titus to attempt to explain away the fog as a power-inhibiting haze inside of a virtual world.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game went on to collect \"worst game of the year\" awards for 1999 from multiple publications and has gone on to garner a reputation as one of the worst games ever made. In 2008, it was made the subject of an episode of the internet game retrospective series <i>The Angry Video Game Nerd</i>. The show's host, <a href=\"/the-angry-video-game-nerd/3005-17775/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17775\">James Rolfe</a>, reviewed the game due to popular demand. In the episode, he brought specific attention to the game's poor collision detection, character animation, and lack of checkpoints. He capped the episode off in a sequence that depicts him as flying off into outer space like Superman and flinging the game into the sun.</p>","resource_type":"game","expected_release_month":null,"deck":"The N64 Superman title is universally considered one of the worst videogames ever made, due to poor choices made in every aspect

story follows the story of the <a href=\"/superman/3005-47/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-47\"> Superman</a> comic, Superman: Y2K, in which<a href=\"/brainiac-13/3005-10210/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10210\"> Brainiac 13</a> injects a virus into the city of <a href=\"/metropolis/3035-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-114\"> Metropolis</a>. The Man of Steel was able to stop the virus but it did cause Metropolis to become a \"City of Tomorrow\". Metropolis then had cars that could hover and huge high-tech buildings that reached higher than ever before.</p><p>The game begins with Brainiac 13's return to harvest the technology from the city. This causes chaos to erupt in Metropolis and leaves Superman with the only option of stopping Brainiac 13. Besides the game featuring the city of Metropolis, the game also visits places such as the orbit above Earth, an asteroid field, and the Phantom Zone.</p><h3>Other Villains</h3><p>Besides Brainiac 13, other villains make an appearance in the game. Those villains include <a href=\"/lex-luthor/3005-6225/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6225\"> Lex Lutho</a>r, <a href=\"/mongul/3005-10161/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10161\"> Mongul</a>, <a href=\"/bizarro/3005-8598/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8598\"> Bizarro</a> #1, and Hank Henshaw.</p><h2>Writers</h2><p>Superman: The Man of Steelwas written by DC Comic writer<a href=\"/scott-peterson/3040-19639/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-19639\"> Scott Peterson</a>. Scott Peterson is famous for his work with DC Comics. Scott Peterson also went on to work for the story of the adaptation of the <a href=\"/batman-begins/3030-34/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34\"> Batman Begins</a> video game.</p><h2>Superman's Powers</h2><p>Unlike <a href=\"/superman-64/3030-20702/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20702\"> Superman 64</a> the player has most of Superman's powers at the ready. Among the powers include super strength, super hearing, X-ray vision, ice breath, and flight. <a href=\"/super-speed/3015-291/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-291\"> Super speed</a> can be used when flying and will show a streak of red and blue to show you are flying faster.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>While the game fared better than <a href=\"/superman-64/3030-20702/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20702\"> Superman 64</a>, the game did not receive much positive feedback. Reviewers stated the game had confusing controls and that Superman was awkward to control. The game was also stated to have repetitive mission modes. <a href=\"/voice-acting/3015-1413/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1413\"> Voice acting</a> was also not well received. Superman's voices were called stereotypical and sounded like a radio announcer.</p>","resource_type":"game","expected_release_month":null,"deck":"Exclusive to the Xbox and had a story written by veteran DC Comics writers.","date_last_updated":"2016-07-05 14:20:48","original_release_date":"2002-11-19 00:00:00","platforms":[{"name":"Xbox","api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-32/","id":32,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox/3045-32/","abbreviation":"XBOX"}],"id":16118,"expected_release_year":null,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/superman-the-man-of-steel/3030-16118/","expected_release_day":null,"date_added":"2008-04-01 16:25:23","original_game_rating":null},{"aliases":null,"number_of_user_reviews":0,"name":"Batman v Superman: Who Will Win","expected_release_quarter":null,"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-52935/","image":{"super_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2832366-bvs.png","thumb_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2832366-bvs.png","tiny_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2832366-bvs.png","medium_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2832366-bvs.png","small_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2832366-bvs.png","screen_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2832366-bvs.png","icon_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2832366-bvs.png"},"description":null,"resource_type":"game","expected_release_month":null,"deck":"The official game based on Warner Bros.' 2016 film \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\".","date_last_updated":"2016-03-06 10:28:03","original_release_date":"2016-02-29 00:00:00","platforms":[{"name":"iPhone","api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-96/","id":96,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/iphone/3045-96/","abbreviation":"IPHN"},{"name":"iPad","api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-121/","id":121,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/ipad/3045-121/","abbreviation":"IPAD"},{"name":"Android","api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-123/","id":123,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/android/3045-123/","abbreviation":"ANDR"}],"id":52935,"expected_release_year":null,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/batman-v-superman-who-will-win/3030-52935/","expected_release_day":null,"date_added":"2016-03-06 10:17:40","original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/","id":29,"name":"ESRB: E10+"}]},{"aliases":null,"number_of_user_reviews":0,"name":"Factor 5's Superman Project","expected_release_quarter":null,"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25555/","image":{"super_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/925350-superman_factor5_011.jpg","thumb_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/925350-superman_factor5_011.jpg","tiny_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/925350-superman_factor5_011.jpg","medium_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/925350-superman_factor5_011.jpg","small_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/925350-superman_factor5_011.jpg","screen_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/925350-superman_factor5_011.jpg","icon_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/925350-superman_factor5_011.jpg"},"description":"<p><em>This game is canceled, and should not have a release date or be attached to any concept, object, location, or character except the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/canceled-games/3015-2310/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2310\">Canceled Games</a> page.
