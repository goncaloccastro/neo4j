After being trained as a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-12\" href=\"/ninja/3015-12/\" slug=\"ninja\">ninja</a> in the mysterious League of Shadows (led by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10163\" href=\"/ras-al-ghul/3005-10163/\" slug=\"ras-al-ghul\">Ra's al Ghul</a>) and stopping them (after finding out their true intentions of cleansing Gotham by destroying it), he returns to Gotham and dons the persona of the caped crusader, Batman. Following the plot of the movie (also including modified scenes from the movie in key cutscenes), Batman investigates an illegal drug shipment of crime boss Carmine Falcone, only to find intricate plots by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4907\" href=\"/scarecrow/3005-4907/\" slug=\"scarecrow\">Dr. Jonathan Crane</a> (a fear-manipulating psychiatrist at <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1236\" href=\"/arkham-asylum/3035-1236/\" slug=\"arkham-asylum\">Arkham Asylum</a>, later known as The Scarecrow) and Ra's al Ghul.</p><p>One of the key elements of Batman Begins that separate it from the other Batman games is the concept of fear as a weapon. By performing certain actions, such as performing special interactions with the environment or taking out enemies in the vicinity, nearby enemies can become afraid. Scared enemies can have a variety of negative effects, such as sloppy fighting techniques, bad weapon aim, and (when very afraid) total disarmament. Batman can also <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5919\" href=\"/interrogation/3015-5919/\" slug=\"interrogation\">interrogate</a> most enemies, instilling fear while obtaining certain information or keys.</p><h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2><h3>Combat: Fear &amp; Interrogation</h3><p>Fear is your weapon in Batman Begins as you are able to interact with a lot of your environment to take out enemies one at a time causing the remaining criminals to cringe in fear. This fear aids you in combat as the opponents that are scared of you are much easier targets. Moreover, fear allows opponents to give up information quicker. This is done through small sequences where Batman picks up an enemy who is trying to get away and interrogates him by punching him and asking him questions. Two of the face-buttons correspond to punching and kicking and another is for performing multiple enemy attacks and finishing moves. However the game does not have a very extensive amount of moves which Batman is known for and the animations are very repetitive.</p><h3><b>The Batmobile</b></h3><p>The Batmobile sequences in this game are few and far between and resemble the Burnout games. The Batmobile can race through the streets of Gotham and ram vehicles off the side of the</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Following the plot of the movie, Batman Begins tells the tale of Bruce Wayne's ascent from rich playboy to feared superhero.</p><p>When Bruce Wayne was just a child, he watched a mugger savagely gun his parents down out of desperation. As he grew, Wayne couldn't handle the pain inside of him and chose to travel the world learning about criminals, and the methods that can be used to disarm them. Having accumulated basic training, Wayne found himself in prison after trying to steal some of the merchandise from his own company, Wayne Enterprises in Eastern Asia. When he is sent to a two-bit prison he is confronted by a man called Henry Ducard who proposes Bruce join the League of Shadows, a force presenting justice to unjust places throughout the world. soon after, Bruce is released from prison and makes his way to the League of Shadows, based on top of a mountain. Impressing the League's leader, Ra's Al Ghul, Bruce trains with the League and develops his skill.</p><p>Eventually Henry presents Bruce with his final challenge, to kill a farmer who murdered another man. Bruce refuses and gets into a battle which kills Ra's and blows up the League. Bruce saves Ducard however, based on a mentor-student relationship that they have developed.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9726/266431-batbmultiscrnbatman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266431\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74945054945055\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9726/266431-batbmultiscrnbatman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266431\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9726/266431-batbmultiscrnbatman.jpg\" alt=\"Batman\"></a><figcaption>Batman</figcaption></figure><p>Returning to Gotham, Bruce begins to craft Batman, a vigilante persona he can adopt in order to wage war on the criminal syndicates throughout the city whilst protecting the people he cares about.</p><p>As Batman begins eliminating crime throughout the city, he learns of a grander scheme, one that involves a mysterious psychologist named Jonathan Crane, who poses as the Scarecrow, dumping a weaponised hallucinogen into the water mains.

Should the player be unable to make sense of the clues and fail to arrive at set locations on time, the game will be over. Most of the crimes throughout the game are directly taken from the movie, and the game follows the film's plot for the most part, but some missions were specifically created for the game.</p>","resource_type":"game","expected_release_month":null,"deck":"As Batman, Robin, or Batgirl, roam the streets of Gotham City and use your detective skills to foil the plans of Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Bane in this video game tie-in with the 1997 film of the same name.","date_last_updated":"2014-09-24 16:42:47","original_release_date":"1998-08-07 00:00:00","platforms":[{"name":"PlayStation","api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-22/","id":22,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation/3045-22/","abbreviation":"PS1"},{"name":"Game.Com","api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-77/","id":77,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/gamecom/3045-77/","abbreviation":"GCOM"},{"name":"R-Zone","api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-103/","id":103,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/r-zone/3045-103/","abbreviation":"RZON"}],"id":13568,"expected_release_year":null,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/batman-robin/3030-13568/","expected_release_day":null,"date_added":"2008-04-01 16:09:54","original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/","id":1,"name":"ESRB: T"}]},{"aliases":null,"number_of_user_reviews":4,"name":"Batman Returns","expected_release_quarter":null,"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-9710/","image":{"super_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2361162-nes_batmanreturns.jpg","thumb_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2361162-nes_batmanreturns.jpg","tiny_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2361162-nes_batmanreturns.jpg","medium_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2361162-nes_batmanreturns.jpg","small_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2361162-nes_batmanreturns.jpg","screen_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2361162-nes_batmanreturns.jpg","icon_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2361162-nes_batmanreturns.jpg"},"description":"<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3693/345814-ss_07.27.2008_10.49.13pm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-345814\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.87179487179487\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3693/345814-ss_07.27.2008_10.49.13pm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-345814\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3693/345814-ss_07.27.2008_10.49.13pm.jpg\" alt=\"345814-ss_07.27.2008_10.49.13pm.jpg\"></a></figure><p>Batman Returns is an action game based on the 1992 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_Returns\" rel=\"nofollow\">film of the same name</a>.

The SNES version is a traditional side-scrolling action game whereas the Genesis version is a two player game that plays like a shooter.

Press releases from WB Games stated this will be available for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a>, <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">Playstation 3</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Nintendo Wii U</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> versions of the game.</p><p>There will be two maps based on Black Mask via pre-order DLC for Arkham Origins.</p><p>Announced at Sony's E3 2013 press conference. Jack Tretton announced that the PS3 version of Arkham Origins would have <a href=\"http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/06/BatmanCostumes.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">two exclusive costumes and 5 maps</a>. Azrael's Batman costume from the Knightfall storyline and the batsuit from the infamous 1966 Batman TV show, made famous by Adam West.</p><h3>Supported Platforms Confusion</h3><p>The box arts released with the press release and first pre-rendered trailer lack the DLC blurb on the Nintendo Wii U for the UK versions, however, an Italian version of the Wii U box art does feature the DLC blurb on the box art. As of May 24, Amazon.com also listed the pre-order bonus DLC for the Wii U version and later on updated box arts on UK retailer websites appeared, featuring the DLC info. Warner Bros. finally confirmed the Deathstroke DLC for the Wii U version in early July.</p><p> </p><h2>Season Pass</h2><p>Announced on September 26th, 2013. The season pass for Arkham Origins which is available for $19.99/£15.99 offers players five pieces of downloadable content. Two of those pieces are skin packs: the New Millenium Skins Pack and the Infinite Earths Skin Pack. The other two are an exclusive set of challenge maps called the Initiation DLC which lets players play as Bruce Wayne as he trains to become the Dark Knight, though it was misleadingly marketed as a full singleplayer chapter with an emphasis on storyline. The last piece of DLC, called \"Cold, Cold Heart\" was officially released on April 22, 2014. Taking place one week after the events of the main storyline (on New Year's Eve), it tells the tale of Batman's first encounter with the villain <a href=\"/mr-freeze/3005-5866/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5866\">Mister Freeze</a> within the Arkham universe. This last story DLC also introduces players to Batman's XE (Extreme Environment) Suit, designed to protect him against the cold created by Mister Freeze's weapons.</p><p>Exclusive to the season pass are two extra skins, Brightest Day Batman and Gotham by Gaslight Batman.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2564560\"

Along with all the downloadable content, this version features unique controller-based features, as well as a special \"armored suit\" that grants Batman and Catwoman some perks.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Batman: Arkham City is set one year after the events of Arkham Asylum. After taking credit for the take down of <a href=\"/the-joker/3005-952/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-952\">the Joker</a>, Quincy Sharp has managed to become the new <a href=\"/mayor/3015-5846/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5846\">mayor</a> of <a href=\"../../gotham-city/95-111/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gotham City</a>. Despite knowing that Sharp was dangerously psychotic from reading his journal in the first game, Batman did nothing to prevent this. Due to the fact that <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/3035-1236/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1236\">Arkham Asylum</a> and <a href=\"/blackgate-penitentiary/3035-2426/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2426\">Blackgate Prison</a> are both unfit to store prisoners, Sharp has the slums of Gotham walled off in order to create a new \"prison\" for the inmates, nicknamed \" <a href=\"/arkham-city/3035-3613/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3613\">Arkham City</a>\". With the walls in place, Sharp lets the inmates loose with one simple rule: not to try and escape. Psychologist <a href=\"/hugo-strange/3005-16295/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16295\">Hugo Strange</a> is brought in as the 'warden' of this new prison.</p><p>Sharp secretly hopes that by placing all the dangerous Gotham criminals into an isolated part of the city, they will simply all kill each other, thus getting rid of the criminal problem in Gotham. However, the criminals quickly form into different gangs, all led by Batman's toughest enemies. One is lead by the Joker, with <a href=\"///\">Harley Quinn</a> at his side. <a href=\"/two-face/3005-4995/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4995\">Two-Face</a> also leads a gang, but since he was only recently placed in the facility, he has to prove his worth to build up a powerful gang. He plans to do this by killing <a href=\"../../catwoman/94-654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Catwoman</a>. The third major gang belongs to <a href=\"/the-penguin/3005-5818/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5818\">the Penguin</a>, who has somehow manged to arm his minions with cutting-edge military technology.</p><p>The game begins with the player playing as Bruce Wayne, who has taken a sudden interest in politics, and is trying to get Arkham City closed down. During a press conference, Strange's men (a mercenary strike team called TYGER) interfere and capture Bruce. Batman's alter-ego wakes up strapped to a chair, as Strange reveals that he knows Bruce is Batman, and that soon everything will end when he unleashes \"Protocol 10\". Bruce is set free in Arkham City, briefly tangles with the Penguin's men, and climbs a building in order to get a signal to his allies. Bruce orders Alfred to send him his suit via the Batwing, and Bruce Wayne gives way to Batman.</p><p>Batman hears that Catwoman is being held by Two-Face in the courthouse. Determined to find out what Protocol 10 is, the Caped Crusader decides to go and save Selina in hopes that she'll know more about what's going on. After saving the cat and barely avoiding an assassination attempt from the Joker, Batman decides to go and pay the Joker a visit at his base in the steel mill. The Joker is deathly ill, suffering the aftereffects of the massive dose of Titan he injected himself with at the end of the first game, and his gang is controlled for the most part by Harley Quinn. Upon arriving at Joker's location, Joker fakes his death with a double and captures Batman. The Bat wakes up tied to a wheelchair, with an IV in his arm administering Joker's contaminated blood to him. The Joker explains that he will be dead in a matter of hours and now, so will Batman. There is no cure to his sickness, as all the doctors the psycho brought in have failed to cure him. <a href=\"/mr-freeze/3005-5866/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5866\">Mister Freeze</a> was developing a cure before he was kidnapped by the Penguin. Furthermore, the Joker has anonymously donated his poisoned blood to every hospital in Gotham City, so that even if he dies, he'll have the last laugh. Batman now only has a couple of hours to find a cure before he, and the innocent people who receive the Joker's blood, die. As a token of his gratitude for his \"help\", the Joker pushes Batman's wheelchair out a five story window, almost killing him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1873622\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1873622\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg\" alt=\"The Penguin\"></a><figcaption>The Penguin</figcaption></figure><p>Batman succeeds in stopping the Penguin and rescuing Freeze, who reveals that he is nowhere close to a cure. Batman figures out that a cure could be fabricated by using <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/3005-10163/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10163\">Ra's al Ghul</a>'s blood. Batman tracks down al Ghul's hideout with a little help from Robin and reunites with <a href=\"/talia-al-ghul/3005-13248/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13248\">Talia al Ghul</a>, his daughter, who loves Batman and knows his secret identity. The only problem is that Batman is sick, very sick. He's so sick that at one point, Oracle asks him what his will to <a href=\"/robin/3005-3822/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3822\">Robin</a> should be, how should he carry on the flame. He even passes out and sees \"The Light\" and his parents, beckoning him to come and join them. He eventually makes it to Ra's' hideout, and has no choice but to accept the trials to become the master of the League of Shadows, as it allows him to drink a mysterious potion called the Demon's Blood, which gives him his strength back, but will only delay the onset of his symptoms by a matter of hours. Batman passes all the trials but refuses to kill Ra's and replace him as the new master of the League. He still succeeds in getting the master's blood and heads back to Freeze, who creates an antidote but betrays the Caped Crusader, hoping to use the antidote as leverage to force Batman to rescue Freeze's wife Nora, still in her cryogenic chamber, who has been 'kidnapped' by the Joker's men. They do battle, and Batman wins, but the antidote was stolen by Harley Quinn during the fight.</p><p>Now genuinely pissed off, Batman goes back to the steel mill to get the cure from a much-healthier looking Joker. Just as the Dark Knight is about to defeat the Clown Prince of Crime, Strange initiates Protocol 10, which is in fact the mass extermination of all prisoners in Arkham City, in order to make the world a better place. Batman is crushed by rubble and is about to get his face ripped off by the Joker when Talia suddenly appears and offers the Joker immortality via her father's Lazarus Pit. Talia takes the Joker away while triggering a homing beacon previously planted on one of her ninjas, so Batman will be able to find her again. Batman is saved by Catwoman, and wants to go after Talia, but Alfred blocks his access to the WayneTech tracking satellites, claiming that Bruce mustn't let emotions get in the way, that Batman was destined to save the world and that this is what he must do.</p><p>With no other choice, Batman goes after Strange, who gloats to his men that soon, facilities like Arkham City will be constructed in other major cities like <a href=\"/metropolis/3035-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-114\">Metropolis</a> and Keystone City. It's revealed that Strange is but a puppet, and has been working for Ra's al Ghul all along, sharing his vision of violently ridding the world of criminal scum. For failing to defeat Batman, Ra's murders Strange, who then triggers Protocol 11, a safeguard which even al Ghul didn't know about - which causes his tower headquarters to violently explode. Batman and al Ghul jump out but Ra's commits suicide with his own sword in the air in an attempt to take Batman with him, which fails. With Protocol 10 stopped, Batman goes to save Talia, who is being held by Joker in a movie theatre. The Joker holds Talia at gunpoint, but she manages to escape her captor and kill the Joker by impaling him with her sword. Batman reprimands Talia for killing the clown right before Talia is shot in the back and killed by... the Joker. It's revealed that the Joker is still very much alive, and very much sick, inches away from dying (much like Batman). The Joker lying dead on the floor isn't actually the Joker, or dead; the healthy Joker Batman has been dealing with since the theft of the cure was <a href=\"/clayface/3005-5776/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5776\">Clayface</a> all along. It turns out that although Harley stole the cure from Mister Freeze, Talia went and stole it right back before it could be administered to the Joker.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1868514\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2798634812287\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1868514\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"The last joke?\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg\" alt=\"The last joke?\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The last joke?</figcaption></figure><p>Batman is forced to fight Clayface, and eventually defeats him thanks to the ice grenades he was given by Mister Freeze, and obtains the cure. Batman drinks half of the cure, becoming healthy again, as the Joker laughs his head off at Talia's death. The Clown Prince of Crime explains that despite the fact that the Joker has created so much mayhem and has killed the one woman who has ever loved Batman, the Dark Knight is still forced to save him as that is his rule of conduct. As Batman debates whether or not to save him, the Joker attacks him, causing the hero to drop the cure which breaks on the ground. Batman looks on as the Joker tries to save the cure, and states that despite all the mayhem, he would've saved him. Shocked, the Joker dies with a smile on his face. Batman walks the Joker's corpse out of Arkham City and leaves it on a police car. <a href=\"/james-gordon/3005-6404/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6404\">Commissioner Gordon</a> arrives, asking Batman \"What the hell happened in there?\". The Caped Crusader ignores the question and just walks away.</p><h3>Epilogue</h3><p>If players go back to the steel mill, where Joker's base of operations were set up, they'll see Harley Quinn's original uniform. By the uniform is a pregnancy test. The pregnancy test shows positive (+). In the finale of the credits, players can hear Harley Quinn singing a lullaby. The song goes, \"hush little baby don't say a word, momma's gonna kill for you the whole damn world.\" This was originally interpreted by fans to mean as a hint towards a potential plot point in a sequel with Harley carrying the Joker's child. However, the follow-up story DLC Harley Quinn's Revenge puts this possibility to rest as it shows that the original pregnancy test was actually a false positive and that Harley was not in fact pregnant. </p><h3>Catwoman</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799980\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.28\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799980\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"What are Catwoman's true motives?\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png\" alt=\"What are Catwoman's true motives?\"></noscript></a><figcaption>What are Catwoman's true motives?</figcaption></figure><p>Catwoman, Selina Kyle, has a different storyline than Batman's that takes place over four episodes. Catwoman starts the game while trying to steal a microchip from Two-Face, who captures her and dangles her over a vat of acid. She's saved by Batman, and further damages Two-Face's face. After leaving Batman's company she resolves to steal the valuables Dr. Strange has seized from Arkham's prisoners. Catwoman asks Poison Ivy for help, and after fighting some of her goons, she is convinced to creates a hole allowing Catwoman to get inside the vault.</p><p>After defeating several guards she leaves the vault only to be confronted by a picture of Batman trapped underneath some rubble. There are two possible endings to the situation. One is that she has a sudden change of heart and decides to go to Batman's aid. The other is that she abandons Batman to his fate, and the game ends. After a while the credits will rewind and give the player the opportunity to make the \"right\" choice. After saving Batman, Catwomen goes back to her apartment to get the rest of the loot that she stole from Strange before escaping from Arkham. Only to discover that Two-Face has stolen all of it. Selina tracks Dent down but realizes that he's sold half of the loot already. Catwoman's role ends with her searching for her missing loot.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Arkham City's gameplay is similar to its predecessor with some added touches. Batman's movements default to a walk. Holding down the run button will make Batman run and jump over certain obstacles. Pressing the run button twice will make Batman roll.</p><p>Movement in Arkham City isn't just limited to running around. Batman has his trusty grappling hook and cape to help him fly around. Batman can use his grappling hook to shoot himself up to ledges, and the grapnel boost upgrade propels him above ledges where he can use his cape to glide. Batman can now dive bomb while gliding. This can be used to take out enemies, solve puzzles or glide some more. Batman can also wall jump to keep on gliding in tight spaces.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1811248\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1811248\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Stealth is a major component of Arkham City.\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg\" alt=\"Stealth is a major component of Arkham City.\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stealth is a major component of Arkham City.</figcaption></figure><p>Combat in Arkham City is a mix of one button combos and counters. Batman kicks and punches with the press of one button. As he racks up a combo, his moves become quicker and more aggressive. Batman can also counter enemy attacks. He can counter up to 3 attacks at once. Finally, if an enemy is knocked down, Batman can finish them off. Chaining attacks makes the multiplier go up. Once the player has reached x10, he can unleash a devastating attack (Batman calls in bats that stun all surrounding enemies; Batman jumps into the air, throwing Batarangs at all enemies on the ground, finishing them off). Some of these attacks will stop the multiplier while getting hit by an attack will set the combo multiplier back to zero. Arkham City adds critical strikes where if the player times his strikes correctly, he can inflict a critical blow on his foes. Batman can also use stealth, hiding on top of gargoyles or in vents, silently taking down enemies (there are also smack-downs during these stealth takedowns where players can quicken the takedown but risk alerting nearby guards).</p><p>Detective Vision lets Batman see weak structures, hidden fuse boxes and power lines. It's also very useful during stealth as it tells the player how many enemies there are in the area, how many are armed and what their state of mind is. Detective mode can also be used to solve Riddler Challenges.

Although the levels are side-scrolling, players can move anywhere around the level. Players can move him around with the analog stick, crouch with the Crouch button (C-Right on the N64), run with the Run button (L button on the N64), and jump with the Jump button (R button on the N64). He can attack using the Punch button (B button on the N64) and the Kick button (A button on the N64), and can block attacks using the Block button (Z button on the N64). Some of his abilities can be used with the Special button (C-Left on the N64).</p><h3>Bat Suits</h3><p>At any point in the game, players can switch between four different types of loadouts (called \"bat suits\") for Batman using the D-Pad, changing both his stats and his special abilities.</p><ul><li><p><b>Standard Suit</b> - By wearing the Standard Suit, Batman can use his arsenal of gadgets (which can be used with the Special button and cycled through using the D-Pad): the Dark Knight Discus (thrown projectiles that require ammunition), the Dark Knight <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1761\" href=\"/bo/3055-1761/\" slug=\"bo\">Staff</a> (a staff swing which attacks in a circular area), and the Magnetic <a data-ref-id=\"3055-707\" href=\"/nunchaku/3055-707/\" slug=\"nunchaku\">Nunchuku</a> (a nunchuck attack which can be charged).</p></li><li><p><b>Offensive Suit</b> - More fragile than his other suits, the Offensive Suit is capable of stronger attack power and the ability to punch open certain crates. This suit allows him to perform a rolling kick (by pressing the Special button) and a low kick (by pressing the Crouch button when an enemy is close to him).</p></li><li><p><b>Defensive Suit</b> - Sacrificing his normal attacking power for better protection, the Defensive Suit gives him advanced shielding, allowing him to deflect most enemy attacks (using either the Special or Crouch buttons). He can also use his shielding to perform a damage-dealing Shield Punch by pressing the Special button while moving.</p></li><li><p><b>Nimble Suit</b> - While wearing the agility-oriented Nimble Suit and in the air, he can perform a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1\" href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" slug=\"double-jump\">double jump</a> (by hitting the Jump button), a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2747\" href=\"/jump-kick/3015-2747/\" slug=\"jump-kick\">jump kick</a> (by pressing the Kick button), or a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1924\" href=\"/gliding/3015-1924/\" slug=\"gliding\">glide</a> (by holding down the Jump button).</p></li></ul>","resource_type":"game","expected_release_month":null,"deck":"Take on the mantle of the Tomorrow Knight as he takes on a ghost of his mentor's past, the clown prince of crime, in this beat-em-up tie-in to the 2000 animated movie of the same name.","date_last_updated":"2012-07-28 21:03:39","original_release_date":"2000-11-20 00:00:00","platforms":[{"name":"PlayStation","api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-22/","id":22,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation/3045-22/","abbreviation":"PS1"},{"name":"Nintendo 64","api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-43/","id":43,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-64/3045-43/","abbreviation":"N64"},{"name":"Game Boy Color","api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-57/","id":57,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/game-boy-color/3045-57/","abbreviation":"GBC"}],"id":1238,"expected_release_year":null,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/batman-beyond-return-of-the-joker/3030-1238/","expected_release_day":null,"date_added":"2008-04-01 01:38:42","original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/","id":6,"name":"ESRB: E"}]},{"aliases":null,"number_of_user_reviews":0,"name":"Batman: The Caped Crusader","expected_release_quarter":null,"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-19482/","image":{"super_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/705104-bat_cc.jpg","thumb_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/705104-bat_cc.jpg","tiny_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/705104-bat_cc.jpg","medium_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/705104-bat_cc.jpg","small_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/705104-bat_cc.jpg","screen_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/705104-bat_cc.jpg","icon_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/705104-bat_cc.jpg"},"description":"<p>Batman: the Caped Crusader was unique for its time in both its gameplay and graphical style. In what was essentially a puzzle game, the player controlled Batman trying his best to foil the plans of both The Joker and The Penguin. But instead of punching people in the face and driving the Batmobile at lightning speeds, the game has more in common with the adventure games genre; forcing the player solve puzzles, match objects in the correct locations and solve puzzles which required backtracking to previously visited locations. <br/> <br/>The graphical style was based around comic book panels. Enter a new location and the old area you just left didn't disappear, but rather it greyed out and faded into the background. The panels piled on top of each other, the top most being the current location.  <br/> <br/>One of the indirect failings of Batman: The Caped Crusader was to do with its complexity. Nowhere in the game is it explained what you have to do, or how you can do it. As for most games of the nineteen-eighties, the instructions lie in the accompanying manual. As the game spread on different platforms, the pirated versions appeared on the Commodore 64, Amstrad, and ZX Spectrum. Unfortunately, games of these platforms and era fell victim to rampant piracy, with kids not buying games but getting copies from their friends. Batman: The Caped Crusader was one of thses and as a result, if the player was without a manual - the game became a series of trial and error exchanges as the player had no clue how to proceed in the game without repeatedly pressing keys on their keyboard in the hope of stopping The Joker and Penguin.</p>","resource_type":"game","expected_release_month":null,"deck":"A standard action platforming affair that is split into two parts.

The Video Game is a platforming game based on the 1989 <a href=\"/tim-burton/3040-103114/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-103114\">Tim Burton</a>-directed superhero movie of the same name. The plot loosely follows that of the film and stars titular protagonist <a href=\"/batman/3005-66/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-66\">Batman</a> as he fights to rescue photojournalist <a href=\"/vicki-vale/3005-10215/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10215\">Vicki Vale</a> and liberate <a href=\"/gotham-city/3035-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-111\">Gotham City</a> from <a href=\"/the-joker/3005-952/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-952\">the Joker</a> and his army of villainous henchmen. <a href=\"/sunsoft/3010-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-19\">Sunsoft</a> developed and published three distinct versions of the game between 1989 and 1992 for <a href=\"/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a>, <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a> and <a href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Genesis</a>; a common practice for <a href=\"/licensed-game/3015-1098/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1098\">licensed games</a> of the era. While all three versions of Batman share some similarities in terms of story and basic platforming, each iteration features unique graphics, sound, gameplay mechanics and level designs.</p><h2>NES Version</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3936/292428-1053726259_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-292428\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3936/292428-1053726259_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-292428\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3936/292428-1053726259_00.gif\" alt=\"292428-1053726259_00.gif\"></a></figure><p>The <a href=\"/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> saw Sunsoft's initial release of Batman: The Video Game in late December 1989 in Japan, with North American and European releases the following year.</p><p>A prototype version of the NES release was featured in the September/October 1989 issue of <em>Nintendo Power</em> magazine. The unreleased prototype included <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes</a> drawn in a style reminiscent of the Batman <a href=\"/games-based-on-comic-books/3015-4051/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4051\">comic books</a> of the era, whereas the game's retail release added redrawn scenes and characters that more closely resemble those of the film. The <em>Nintendo Power</em> preview also depicts <a href=\"/1-up/3055-77/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-77\">1-Up</a> items which are not present in the final NES version.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>The player uses the directional pad to move Batman through each stage. Pressing Down makes Batman duck, which is useful for avoiding projectiles or attacking low-lying enemies. The B button causes Batman to throw a basic punch or fire his equipped weapon, and the A button is used to jump. Tapping A performs a short hop, while holding the button down allows players to jump much higher. Batman can also use his <a href=\"/wall-jump/3015-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5\">wall jump</a> ability to reach even greater heights or bypass sections of certain stages; mastering this ability becomes critical in the game's later stages in order to progress. Pressing the Start button allows Batman to switch between his selected weapons, whereas the Select button pauses the game.</p><p>Batman begins the game with three <a href=\"/lives/3015-323/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-323\">lives</a> and eight units of <a href=\"/health/3015-130/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">health</a> per life. Touching an enemy or its projectiles causes Batman to lose a single unit of health. When players deplete their entire stock of lives, they receive a <a href=\"/game-over/3015-372/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-372\">game over</a> and are prompted to either <a href=\"/continue/3015-635/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-635\">continue</a> from the beginning of the current sub-stage or end their game.</p><h4>Weapons</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/fist/3055-693/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-693\"><b>Fists</b></a>: Batman throws punches as his default method of attack, which can destroy most enemies in only a few hits. Unlike Batman's other selectable weapons, punching does not consume <a href=\"/ammo/3055-533/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-533\">ammunition</a>, but his melee range is severely limited.</li><li><a href=\"/batarang/3055-2043/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2043\"><b>Batarang</b></a>: A mid-range <a href=\"/boomerang/3055-76/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-76\">boomerang</a> weapon thrown straight ahead that quickly returns to Batman's location. It consumes one unit of ammo per throw and is capable of multiple strikes against a single enemy with proper use.</li><li><a href=\"/spear-gun/3055-3513/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3513\"><b>Spear Gun</b></a>: This weapon consumes two units of ammo per shot. It fires projectiles straight ahead that can travel across the full length of the screen, making the Spear Gun well-suited for long-range attacks.</li><li><b>Dirk</b>: An unusual weapon that fires three disc-shaped projectiles that travel straight ahead across the screen. The Dirk consumes three units of ammo per shot and is useful against enemies that stay low to the ground, such as sliding <a href=\"/proximity-mines/3055-1309/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1309\">mines</a>.</li></ul><h4>Power-Ups</h4><ul><li><b>Bonus Item</b>: Adds 1,000 points to the player's <a href=\"/high-score/3015-260/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-260\">high score</a>.</li><li><b>Pellet Item</b>: Replenishes ten units of ammo, which is shared between all weapons.</li><li><b>Heart Item</b>: Restores one of Batman's eight <a href=\"/hit-points/3015-400/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-400\">hit points</a>.</li></ul><h3>Enemies</h3><ul><li><b>Shakedown and <a href=\"/maxie-zeus/3005-24154/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24154\">Maxiezeus</a></b>: Standard <a href=\"/fodder-enemies/3015-7139/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7139\">fodder enemies</a> that run straight towards Batman and appear at least once per stage.</li><li><b>Mobile Tracker</b>: A small robot fitted with spikes that slowly patrols in certain areas. Its speed increases while Batman stands nearby on the same platform.</li><li><b>Heatwave</b>: Stationary henchmen that attack intermittently with <a href=\"/flamethrower/3055-45/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-45\">flamethrowers</a>. They're often encountered on narrow platforms or vertically-oriented passages.</li><li><b><a href=\"/deadshot/3005-20448/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20448\">Deadshot</a></b>: Another stationary enemy that occasionally takes a single shot at Batman with his pistol.</li><li><b>Mobile Home Mine</b>: A mobile <a href=\"/proximity-mines/3055-1309/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1309\">proximity mine</a> that quickly slides across the ground when Batman gets close. It can be evaded by jumping; players can also destroy these mines from a distance with Dirks.</li><li><b>The Enforcer</b>: A <a href=\"/jet-pack/3055-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6\">jetpack</a>-equipped enemy that guards the rooftops in Stage 1-2. He fires a machine gun at Batman while hovering around, but a few well-placed Batarangs can make short work of him.</li><li><b>K.G. Beast</b>: A unique <a href=\"/ninja/3015-12/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-12\">ninja</a> enemy that only appears once at the end of Stage 1-2. When first encountered, this enemy is reclining against a wall, giving Batman a chance to defeat the ninja quickly before he reacts.</li><li><b>Nightslayer</b>: Slow-moving henchmen equipped with massive claws on their arms that appear in Stages 2 and 4. By striking quickly, Batman can eliminate them at close range.</li><li><b>Javelin</b>: Introduced in the second stage, this stationary device repeatedly extends its long, spear-like arm toward players. While relatively easy to destroy, these can become a serious obstacle in jumping-focused areas.</li><li><b>Drop Claw</b>: Another stationary enemy mounted on ceilings. It regularly dispenses small mines that drop to the floor and track towards Batman.</li><li><b>Jader</b>: These large <a href=\"/mutants/3015-733/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-733\">mutant</a> enemies are biological weapons developed by Joker with impressive leaping abilities. Fast and difficult to dodge, they can also absorb significant damage from Batman's weapons.</li><li><b>EEV</b>: Encountered in Stages 3 and 5, these goon-controlled mini-<a href=\"/tank/3055-92/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-92\">tanks</a> fire large projectiles at players from long range.</li><li><b>Rail Runner</b>: Robotic enemies appearing briefly in Stage 4. Mounted on a horizontal rail, it travels left-to-right while trying to crash into Batman.</li></ul><h3>Stages</h3><p>The NES version of Batman: The Video Game consists of five total Stages, each of which is split into two or more sub-stages. Batman must defeat the <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">boss</a> at the end of each Stage to proceed.</p><p><strong>Stage 1: Gotham City</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236051-batman_screen.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236051\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236051-batman_screen.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236051\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/33/236051-batman_screen.gif\" alt=\"Killer Moth\"></a><figcaption>Killer Moth</figcaption></figure><p>After the game's opening cutscene featuring the <a href=\"/batmobile/3055-1231/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1231\">Batmobile</a>, Batman hits the mean streets of Gotham City, fighting the Joker's low-level goons as he passes through Gotham's deserted downtown district. The Stage's second area takes place among several high-rise buildings and introduces players to the concept of wall jumping. A crafty ninja called K.G. Beast waits for Batman near the end of this area to challenge the Caped Crusader before he can proceed to Stage 1's boss fight.</p><p>Batman encounters the first boss, <a href=\"/killer-moth/3005-6424/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6424\">Killer Moth</a>, at the front steps of Gotham City Hall. This flying foe swoops around the screen and fires blue projectiles in a fan-shaped pattern.

Much of the first section of this Stage is half-flooded and contains exposed spinning turbines that must be avoided. In the second area, the flowing water changes to a bright green color as it spills down into a large chamber. Batman must make his way to the bottom of this room, dealing with additional enemies and turbines before wall-jumping up a narrow passage leading to the third sub-stage, a reddish-colored cavern. The large cavern area contains a few armored EEV mini-tanks that can strike at players from long range.

While traversing the lab, Batman is attacked by several mechanical enemies and the mutant Jader creatures. In the foreground, there are strange cylinders filled with green liquid and three television screens with the Joker's laughing face broadcasting. The Storage Room (4-2) is marked by the Joker's trademark greens and purples. Batman starts out platform jumping over several grinding gears from below. Soon, the same gears are cranking from all sides.</p><p>Once Batman enters the Thermal Processing Plant (4-3), Batman starts out across from the Exit door he must reach, but the jump is too far. In this area, he jumps down several floors evading the dangerous track bots and live circuits. There's also a large pool of flames that Batman must avoid at all cost. Part of the laboratory here is starting to deteriorate. Eventually, Batman comes to several tiny moving treads that he must use to platform and wall jump while evading Mobile Units and live circuits. Finally, he accends the stairs, fighting off several enemies to reach the Exit door.</p><p>The Dual-Container Alarm (4-4) are two large cubes that move opposite each other across the room's walls. Both of these containers fire projectiles at Batman to the left and to the right. These containers are very slow moving and can be evaded easily if Batman fights in the proper area. After the first container is destroyed, the remaining cube enters a state of emergency, opening from the top and erupting with several fire bombs. These six projectiles move across the screen and can be hard to avoid as the container skims across the bottom of the room.</p><p>After the boss is defeated, Batman hops into his Batwing and flies towards the Cathedral where the Joker has escaped to.</p><p><strong>Stage 5: Cathedral</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861804-the_joker.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2861804\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861804-the_joker.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2861804\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Final battle with the Joker\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2861804-the_joker.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2861804-the_joker.jpg\" alt=\"Final battle with the Joker\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Final battle with the Joker</figcaption></figure><p>When Batman enters the Stairway (5-1), he's immediately faced with more grinding gears and more flamethrower goons. After scaling the stairway, Batman then begins to scale the Belltower itself. This involves an epic wall jump scenario wherein Batman must avoid several javelin bots, grinding gears, flamethrowers, Mobile Units and Drop Claws. Perhaps this was the implimentation of today's Vertical Combat concept?</p><p>Batman is thrust immediately into a boss fight (5-2) against Firebug. Working as Joker's bodyguard, Firebug wants revenge against the Batman for defeating his brother. This horned villain from the comic books conjures six-hundred million degree fireballs, tossing them at Batman while he jumps around the stage rapidly. Firebug is easy enough to defeat, but leads into the final battle with The Joker.</p><p>Joker: \"Greetings Batbrain - Are you ready to meet your destiny?\"</p><p>The final confrontation (5-3) pits Batman against The Joker himself. Wearing the trademark purple suit and green hair, The Joker fires powerful bullets from the massive, long pistol he uses in the film before, of course, summoning three lightning bolts. They have to make a boss fight against a mastermind like The Joker more interesting, right? After a tough, strategic battle, Batman knocks The Joker out. He tries to stand, but only manages to fall back down in defeat. Cue the next cutscene.</p><p>Batman: \"I know you murdered my parents. Now you will dance with the devil in the pale moonlight!\"</p><p>Then throws him off the very top of the belltower. We see The Joker fall from the belltower then a shot of his body alone, underneath a streetlamp before a close up on his smiling face fades to black.</p>","resource_type":"game","expected_release_month":null,"deck":"A licensed platformer based on the massively-successful 1989 superhero film.

The Joker taunts Batman for falling into his trap and flees deeper into the asylum, as the Blackgate prisoners, who are revealed to be in collusion with Joker, are freed from their cells.</p><p>As Batman travels further through the facility, he finds that <a href=\"/mr-zsasz/3005-10486/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10486\">Victor Zsasz</a> has escaped confinement and taken a guard hostage.

Within the observation room, Batman picks up a flask of alcohol dropped by Boles and syncs his cowl vision to detect trace amounts of alcohol in the air from Boles' breath. His trail leads Batman back to the entrance of Intensive Care, where he find Boles has been murdered, his corpse left on a cot upright with green paint around his mouth, and a sign on his chest reading, \"Dead End.\" Immediately after, a familiar voice comes over Batman's earpiece in the form of <a href=\"/the-riddler/3005-2948/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2948\">the Riddler</a>, who, though not physically present at the Asylum, had previously set-up a little game in the Asylum and the surrounding island, should you choose to accept it. This opens up \"The Riddler's Challenge\" section of the game, where the player may follow clues in each area to discover hidden trophies, biographies, audio logs, etc. Batman immediately starts a trace program and continues after the Joker.</p><p>Batman soon hears that the Joker claims to have placed bombs throughout the city, and is threatening to detonate these bombs if anyone outside Arkham Island tries to enter.

While Batman is in transit, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, causing her plants to wreak havoc throughout the island. After meeting Cash in Arkham Mansion to determine the location of Croc’s lair, Batman returns to Intensive Treatment and is once again attacked by Scarecrow. The Dark Knight resists the evil doctor’s toxin long enough to enter Croc’s lair, where the rabid criminal attacks Scarecrow and drags him into the sewers.</p><p>Batman journeys through Croc’s lair and gathers spore samples, all the while avoiding Croc’s repeated attacks. Once he has collected enough samples, Batman makes his escape by blowing up a section of the floor and plunging Killer Croc into the bowels of Arkham. Batman returns to the Batcave to formulate the Titan antidote, but is forced the leave prematurely after the cave is attacked by Ivy’s mutated plants. The World’s Greatest Detective heads back to the Botanical Gardens for a final confrontation with Ivy.</p><p>On his way through the sewers, Batman learns that Joker is filling the reservoir with Titan and plans to pump it into the Gotham River, contaminating the city’s water supply and transforming most of Gotham City's residents into vicious Titan mutants. Batman succeeds in shutting down the pumps that control the water flow and continues to the gardens to take care of Ivy. The deranged villainess confronts Batman from within a giant, carnivorous plant. Eventually, the Dark Knight succeeds in blasting Ivy out of her pod and injecting her with the Titan antidote, causing the plants that have infected the island to wither and die.</p><p>With only one loose end left to tie, Batman is invited by Joker to his “party,” where Batman is set to be the guest of honour. After defeating a number of Joker’s thugs, the Clown Prince of Crime reveals that he has again captured Commissioner Gordon. He tries to shoot Gordon with a Titan-filled dart, but Batman dives in front of the bolt and takes it himself. Despite the Joker's encouragement to turn into a monster, Batman manages to fight off the transformation through sheer force of will. Joker, frustrated that his perfect night has been ruined by Batman, injects <i>himself</i> with Titan, transforming into a pale monstrosity with razor-sharp claws and a wicked green Mohawk.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5234/1656984-84871952_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1656984\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5234/1656984-84871952_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1656984\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"The Titan Joker fighting Batman near the end of the game.\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5234/1656984-84871952_3.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5234/1656984-84871952_3.jpg\" alt=\"The Titan Joker fighting Batman near the end of the game.\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Titan Joker fighting Batman near the end of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>The Joker brings Batman and Gordon to the roof, where they battle in an electrified combat ring. Batman uses the last of the antidote on himself, leaving Joker in his transformed state and forcing them to do battle mano-a-mano. Eventually, Batman succeeds in eliminating the Joker with an explosive punch to the face, leaving the insane criminal to be carted away by Arkham security (after the transformation wore off, that is) and put back in his cell. As the night ends, the Titan-infused inmates begin to return to normal and the escaped prisoners are locked up. Gordon is reunited with his daughter via radio and thanks Batman for his service to the city. The Dark Knight climbs into the Batwing and flies off into the night, ready to face whatever evils Gotham throws his way.</p><p>A post-credit shot features a box of Titan floating in the bay, where the hand of either Bane, Scarecrow, or Killer Croc reaches up from the water and grasps the box.</p><h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2><p><i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i>'s gameplay focuses on the three key concepts that the title character is most famous for: his prowess in hand-to-hand melee combat, silent elimination of enemies from the shadows, and genius skills in investigation, which have earned him the title \"the world's greatest detective.\"</p><h3>FreeFlow Combat</h3><p>The combat in the game relies on players combining different movements and attacks to help them take down a small and large groups of enemies in a free flowing and fluid combo system that allows players to pick and choose between targets at will. For example, stunning an enemy by swiping them in the face with Batman's cape will give the player time to counter an incoming attack from another enemy, which may result in Batman delivering a takedown maneuver with some gymnastic style as he moves to deal with the next enemy. Combining attacks, stuns and counters allows players some diversity in how they handle multiple enemies and combat in general.</p><p>Additionally, the combat contains some RPG elements in the form of experience points which are gathered by fighting and performing various combos. Accumulating experience points helps towards upgrading Batman's arsenal of gadgets and obtaining more advanced fighting techniques. There is a circular meter running underneath the health bar which fills up as the player gains experience points, so players are aware how close they are to their next opportunity to level-up. The health bar appears only during combat and will replenish itself whenever you gain experience points; nearly all enemy encounters will reward enough XP at the end of the fight to fully replenish Batman's health, but there are a very small amount of environmental hazards that can damage Batman and then leave him with no immediate way to regain his health.</p><h3>Invisible Predator</h3><p>A <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth</a> gameplay mechanic is featured in certain sections of the game, but the player is encouraged to do more than simply avoid contact with enemies. The stealth gameplay has been dubbed \"predatory\" gameplay, where the player's goal is to intimidate and strike fear into their enemies, to hunt them from the shadows rather than merely hiding from them as in the traditional stealth genre. Players may eliminate enemies using silent takedowns, explosions, and environmental fixtures such as gargoyles, fragile walls and glass ceilings.</p><p>Players can use the bodies of enemies or their cries for help to attract the attention of other enemies in the area (or, later in the game, special collars that create an alarm as soon as an enemy is unconscious). This can allow Batman to slip through a doorway without being noticed, or stalk and lay a trap for enemies that have come to inspect a fallen comrade's body .</p><h3><a href=\"/detective-mode/3015-6244/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6244\"><b>Detective Mode</b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62561/1181312-batman2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1181312\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62561/1181312-batman2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1181312\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"These are not actually skeletons\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62561/1181312-batman2.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62561/1181312-batman2.jpg\" alt=\"These are not actually skeletons\"></noscript></a><figcaption>These are not actually skeletons</figcaption></figure><p>Players will be able to use Batman's visor and turn on Detective Mode, which will tint the screen blue and highlight points of interest such as door switches that Batman can interact with. Detective Mode also identifies enemies, even if they are behind cover and informing the player whether the enemy is armed, or about to attack. Using the visor will provide players with a tactical advantage and the ability to plan out a course of action before engaging enemies in combat. The visor also identifies vulnerable areas in the environment that Batman may interact with using his various gadgets, allowing the player to complete the various puzzle solving aspects of the game as well. Detective Mode was one of the few points of the game that was met with criticism, as leaving it on at all times was the most straightforward way to play the game, but left the player viewing the world with a blue, artificial tint, with the carefully modelled features of enemies obscured by the image of their skeletons.</p><h3>Gadgets</h3><p>Batman collects a multitude of gadgets throughout the game, many of which may be utilized both in combat and exploration.</p><ul><li><b><a href=\"/grapnel-gun/3055-4307/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4307\">Grapnel Gun</a></b></li></ul><p>The Grapnel Gun is a gas-powered pistol that fires a piton attached to a high-tension wire, which has the ability to retract that line while accommodating the weight of the user. It has the ability to penetrate or affix itself to most surfaces and provide a stable anchor for the Dark Knight to elevate himself to a more desirable position.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/batarang/3055-2043/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2043\"><b>Batarang</b></a></li></ul><p>One of Batman's signature devices, the Batarang is a <a href=\"/boomerang/3055-76/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-76\">boomerang</a>-like throwing weapon shaped like a bat. The player begins the game with a single Batarang. During exploration, the Batarang may be used to stun enemies that are not aware of Batman's presence, to activate otherwise inaccessible buttons, or to cut down hanging enemies. During combat, striking an enemy with a Batarang stuns them for a brief time, allowing Batman to continue a combo or move on to another foe. The Batarang may be upgraded over the course of the game into the Double- and then Multi-Batarang, eventually allowing Batman to carry and throw up to three Batarangs simultaneously. A fully-upgraded Multi-Batarang may be used to stun up to three enemies at a time.</p><ul><li><b><a href=\"/sonic-batarang/3055-4306/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4306\">Sonic Batarang</a></b></li></ul><p>The Sonic Batarang is a separate Batarang that can be used to attract the attention of guards. Rather than being used to bludgeon and stun enemies, the Sonic Batarang will emit a loud, high-pitched noise once it is embedded in a surface, drawing the attention of curious guards to the area, making it the perfect bait for traps utilizing the Explosive Gel. However, even the Joker's henchmen aren't stupid enough to fall for the same trick more than once, and if a second Sonic Batarang is used in the same Invisible Predator sequence, the guards will simply shoot it from a distance and mock Batman. Once upgraded, the Sonic Batarang can overload the suicide collar of a nearby enemy, knocking him out as well as stunning any nearby enemies.</p><ul><li><b><a href=\"/batclaw/3055-4304/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4304\">Batclaw</a></b></li></ul><p>The Batclaw is a strong grappling hook that Batman can use to pull far away objects towards him. It may also be used to grab enemies and remove ventilation ducts. The Batclaw is later upgraded such that three ropes are used to grab things allowing for Batman to break walls from a distance, or alternately, to grab onto three enemies at once.</p><ul><li><b><a href=\"/explosive-gel/3055-2697/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2697\">Explosive Gel</a></b></li></ul><p>The Explosive Gel, as its name implies, is a jelly-like substance that Batman can spray onto walls and floors, and remotely explode later when he chooses to do so. It has three charges and so only three Explosive Gels can be planted at one time. A later upgrade allows Batman to individually explode a planted gel independently of any other planted gels. Although the Dark Knight is almost <i>always</i> a grim, stoic defender of justice, he shows a rare moment of whimsy while using the Explosive Gel; when placing a gel charge on a floor or wall, he sprays it in the shape of a bat.</p><ul><li><b><a href=\"/line-launcher/3055-4305/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4305\">Line Launcher</a></b></li></ul><p>The Line Launcher is a gas-powered pistol that fires two pitons in opposite directions attached to high-tension wires. Whereas the Grapnel Gun is designed to quickly move the user to a higher position in the environment, this device is concerned with the quick traversal of lateral obstacles. The two pitons bury themselves in parallel objects and allow the user to \"zip\" between the two points, after which the pitons release and the lines wind back into the device.</p><h3>The Riddler's Challenge</h3><p>Optionally, Batman can collect trophies hidden by Edward Nigma a.k.a. the Riddler, by solving various riddles. In addition to trophies, Batman may find interview tapes of the key villains and hidden plaques from \"The Spirit of Arkham\" that Batman can translate, illuminating the dark history of Arkham Asylum. When Riddler hacks into Batman's communications, Batman immediately begins a trace program.</p><p>During the course of the game, Riddler taunts Batman, dismissing his skills as a detective and accusing him of cheating when he solves his riddles. When the player completes 237 of the 240 challenges, a display appears telling Batman the location in Gotham from which Riddler is transmitting. Upon completing the 240th challenge, the Riddler again contacts Batman, angry that the Dark Knight has beaten him. In the background, the player can hear sirens approaching, and before Riddler can complete his supposed backup plan, the police move in and arrest him.</p><h3>Hidden challenge</h3><p>In addition to the 240 main collectibles, there is a hidden message from the spirit of Arkham. This message is only available after finding all of the messages highlighted as Riddler challenges. After identifying all the spirit of Arkham plaques, if Batman returns to the guard control tower in the penitentiary, where Warden Sharpe was kept, the warden is missing and replaced with the final Spirit of Arkham message on the floor. Collecting this unlocks the final message from the Spirit of Arkham in the biographies, and hints at a possible plot point in the sequel.</p><h3>Combat and Predator Challenges</h3><p>Collecting and solving Riddler Challenges unlocks 16 arenas outside of the campaign, divided equally between combat and predator modes. In the combat arenas, the player is pitted against enemies over four rounds, the goal being to rack up as many points as possible. How many points the player is able to achieve dictates how many medals are awarded out of a possible three.</p><p>In the predator arenas, the player has to take out the armed foes by using his cunning skills coupled with the smart use of gadgets. Successfully taking out enemies in certain ways, for example pulling an enemy over a railing, will count towards the number of medals gained.</p><p>The number of medals, combat scores and the time used to complete the predator challenges goes towards unlocking specific <a href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/achievements/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\">trophies/achievements</a>, as well as being listed on a global leaderboard.</p><h2><b>Hidden room</b></h2><p>During the game of the year podcast, Rocksteady announced that they had hid \"<i>many hooks</i>\" that tie into the \"<i>Arkham-verse\"</i> including a hidden room inside of Warden Quincy Sharp's office. The room contained a map of <a href=\"/gotham-city/3035-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-111\">Gotham</a> that has a section quarantined and concept art for the sequel, <a href=\"/batman-arkham-city/3030-29443/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29443\"><i>Batman: Arkham City</i></a>. It went undiscovered for months because it was not visible on the map, took three explosives to destroy the wall sealing the room, and cannot be seen using detective vision.</p><h2><b>Modifying the Game</b></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1559737-batman_of_the_future_by_darkknight11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1559737\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1559737-batman_of_the_future_by_darkknight11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1559737\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Snazzy!\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1559737-batman_of_the_future_by_darkknight11.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1559737-batman_of_the_future_by_darkknight11.jpg\" alt=\"Snazzy!\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Snazzy!</figcaption></figure><p>When the demo for <i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i> was released, many players found out how to modify their Batman character. Players could quickly create their own Batman suit, in any way they could think of. The Rocksteady website had all of the information to change the suit. It is totally legal, and the developers allowed players to use the program called, \"texmod\", to create a different variant of Batman's suit. Obviously, this modifying can only be done on the PC version of the game. Many players have created <a href=\"/terry-mcginnis/3005-14456/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14456\">Batman Beyond</a>, Red Robin, Adam West Batman, <a href=\"/nightwing/3005-8204/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8204\">Nightwing</a>, Owlman, Batzarro, Captain America, Batman of Zur En Arrh, and many other variant of Batman's suit.

It is an original project with the story being written by <a href=\"/paul-dini/3040-90118/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90118\">Paul Dini</a> who is best known as a writer, producer and editor on the highly praised cartoon <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>. <a href=\"/kevin-conroy/3040-30178/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-30178\">Kevin Conroy</a> (Batman/Bruce Wayne) , <a href=\"/mark-hamill/3040-3248/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-3248\">Mark Hamill</a> (the Joker) and <a href=\"/arleen-sorkin/3040-50621/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-50621\">Arleen Sorkin</a> (Harley Quinn) all reprise their respective voice roles from <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>.

This allows for a very, <i>very</i> slightly more immersive experience with more interactive environments - for example, litter or paper on the floor moving around and being flung into the air during combat, or mist swirling around Batman and other characters as they move through it. The most provident use of the PhysX SDK is inside of the scarecrow sequences, where walls crumble into many pieces and are sucked into a vortex.

direct sequel to the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20822\" href=\"/lego-batman-the-videogame/3030-20822/\">Lego Batman</a> game, Lego Batman 2 has expanded its horizons from the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-49\" href=\"/batman/3025-49/\">Batman</a> heroes and villains, and now encompasses many more <a data-ref-id=\"3025-138\" href=\"/dc-universe/3025-138/\">DC</a> properties. A first for the series, Lego Batman 2 introduces <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1413\" href=\"/voice-acting/3015-1413/\">voiced dialogue</a>--featuring an all-star voice cast--for the Lego characters over the mumbling and grumbling from past <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7426\" href=\"/tt-games/3010-7426/\">Traveller's Tales</a>' Lego games.</p><p>The game also has more of an open world style as opposed to the previous <a data-ref-id=\"3025-448\" href=\"/lego/3025-448/\">Lego</a> games' more level-oriented style. The game leaves the player free to explore Gotham City in between missions, with challenges to complete, secrets to find, and gold bricks to collect. This is the series' first foray into an open world gameplay style, one that will be continued in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35576\" href=\"/lego-city-undercover/3030-35576/\">Lego City Undercover.</a></p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes is fairly similar to previous Lego games, with a few new added elements. The meat of the game is still the story mode where up to two players, go through an original story set in the Batman Universe. Players will go level to level, beat up bad guys, do some platforming, and smash up the environment to find collectables and thousands upon thousands of studs, which act as the games currency.</p><p>What's new in Lego Batman 2 is an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-207\" href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\">open world</a> to run around and explore. In between missions players are free to roam around a Legoized version of Gotham City. Players can go about Gotham as any character they want (once completing the story mode), and collect different red and gold bricks, fight bosses, unlock characters and vehicles, and just explore the world.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>Lego Batman 2 features 64 playable characters, three being exclusively available on the handheld versions, and ten of them being pre-order bonuses. Lego Batman 2 also features a fully voiced cast, with <a data-ref-id=\"3040-22863\" href=\"/tara-strong/3040-22863/\">Tara Strong</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-80008\"

Wayne for the Man of The Year award, decides to join forces with The Joker so as he can help become the next US President. After breaking Joker out of Arkham Asylum, along with many other notorious villains, Batman and Robin are called in. After cornering the dastardly duo within Lex's heavily armored truck, they find out that he's making kryptonite and take it back to the Bat Cave for research. It soon turns out that the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1216\" href=\"/kryptonite/3055-1216/\">kryptonite</a> is fake and is actually a tracking device that Joker and Luther used to locate the Bat cave. Overpowering the dynamic duo thanks to Luthor's latest weapon, The Deconstructor--which breaks down any black objects--they are able to steal the real stash of kryptonite Batman keeps in his safe.</p><p>Luthor and The Joker use the kryptonite to power a new highly powerful mech, built to feature the likeness of The Joker. After Batman's Batmobile was destroyed by Luthor, Robin sets to repair it while Superman also arrives to give Batman a hand in stopping The Joker and Luthor. Using The Joker's laughing gas from their newly built robot, Luthor attempts to influence the public into voting for him as President. Batman and Superman are always there to arrive to thwart their plans and inflict an increasing amount of damage to the robot. Eventually Luthor utilises the robot's kryptonite core to severely weaken Superman, hindering his ability fly. Still sticking by Batman, the two continue to do battle against the robot across the city.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2246632-lego_batman_2_still_joker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2246632\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56115107913669\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2246632-lego_batman_2_still_joker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2246632\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2246632-lego_batman_2_still_joker.jpg\" alt=\"2246632-lego_batman_2_still_joker.jpg\"></a></figure><p>After Superman dives right through the core, dealing critical damage to the mech but also weakening himself considerably, Robin manages to return just in time with Batman's newly rebuilt Batmobile - complete with a much brighter color scheme. Leading the mech around the city as it drips krytonite, the duo are able to cause the mech to inadvertently signal members of the Justice League to come to their aid. The combined power of Batman and Robin, along with Cyborg, The Flash, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, are then able to soundly thrash the mech and take both The Joker and Lex Luthor down. But only as Brainiac watches from afar within his spaceship once again plotting to destroy Superman.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><table class=\"t-editor with-border
